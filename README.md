**This is just a simple example for connecting to facebook with OAUTH2.
With this you can do all the reading and writing stuff to facebook.
See the Koala Docs for more.**

### GETTING STARTED

1. Clone the repository
2. Run bundle inside the folder
3. Change APP_ID, APP_SECRET (get this from facebook by registering an app)
4. Add an URL like local.myapp.com pointing to 127.0.0.1 in your `/etc/hosts` file
5. Add local.myapp.com to your App Domains list on facebook
6. Set a long and random string as cookie secret (Line: 12)
7. Start your Server with `$ shotgun`
8. point your browser to `http://local.myapp.com:9393/` and click login

### DOING MORE

At this point you can make calls to the Facebook API (there are some examples in the comment): https://github.com/benben/simple-ruby-facebook-example/blob/master/lib/simple-ruby-facebook-example.rb#L17-L23

From that on, its better to read the [Koala documentation](https://github.com/arsduo/koala), use the [Graph Explorer from Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) and read the [Facebook API Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/) to get an idea what you can do after the
authentication.
